First run POST to CreateData to generate 10,000 documents with the structure (
this may take some time):

{
    colour: "Green",
    size: "large",
    shape: "triangle",
    price: 532
}

Then Change the URL to 'Index':
 - use POST to create index based on the POST data
 - use GET to see the explain plan for the query

Edit the query and try different indexes to get perfect indexing.

Try having two indexes one on colour, and one on shape.
