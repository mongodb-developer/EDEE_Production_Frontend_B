In this example we add multiple documents, all have the same 
value for the field 'x'.

We add one, then begin a logical session and a transaction in that session.

We then add a document as part of the transaction and another
that is not part of it.

When we query inside the transaction we see the first and 
second documents but not the one added after the transaction 
performed its first operation.

When we query outside the transaction, we see the first and third but not the
one uncommitted inside the transaction.

Once we commit we see all three.

If you want to restart you can uncomment the drop() - if you have
an uncommitted transaction on the collection then the drop will
wait for the open transaction to timeout (30s of no activity).
