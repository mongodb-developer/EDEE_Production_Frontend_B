This runs two queries on the same large data set.

One has an index that can be used, and the otehr does not, they return
almost the same number of documents.

It uses countDocuments() rather than find() which performs the find
but only returns the count from the server. This excludes the network
cost of fetching a lot of documents over the network from the
measurement.

An indexed query will be a fairly constant speed, though
you'll also see some significant network overhead in these results.

A collection scan (no index) will place a lot of load on the server,
proportaional to the number of callers so it may be very slow in a 
large class, be patient.
