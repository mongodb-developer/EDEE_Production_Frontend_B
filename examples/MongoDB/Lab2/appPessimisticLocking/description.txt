If we want to lock a record against other edits by our application, we use 
an update to set a field on it to say it's being edited.

In practice you would also add a timeout and information about the editor
to prevent this being locked forever if a client dies.

Use GET to lock the document - calling GET multiple times will fail as it
is already locked.

Use POST to update and release the lock - if you POST an it's not locked 
you will get an error.

For simplicity we have hardcoded lockId but you could make it add a random one
then edit the POST data to prove it.

How could you add a date so a lock expires after a set time and someone else
can get the lock?
