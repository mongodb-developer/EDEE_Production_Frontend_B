When not in an explicit transaction, documents are locked for writes
whilst the update is being applied. These last only microseconds.

Find-Lock-Verify-Update-Unlock

The Verify checks that after locking the Query conditions still apply.

In this example we use Promise.all to run several operations in parallel.

We can see in the results that the order they run in changes - and we will
always have 5 updates.

Uncomment the line to see what happens when we add a query clause to say
an update only happens if the thread is higher than the last updating thread,

This behavior, atomic, short server side write locking and the 
very rich update syntax are a key part of high performance MongoDB systems.
