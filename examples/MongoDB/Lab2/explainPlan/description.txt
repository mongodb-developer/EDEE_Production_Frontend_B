This runs two queries on the same large data set.

One has an index and one does not, they return
almost the same number of documents.

This time we use explain() which does not return results but gives
lots of information about how the query is processed. 

We are removing a few fields but you can see from this if an 
index is used and in 'executionStats' how many how many indexKeys
and documents were examined and how many documents returned.

Ideally you do not ever look at more Documents or Keys than you 
return, if these are higher consider improving the index.
