This is the mechanism used by many ORM frameworks, the record contains a version
field.

Whenever the record is updated the version number is incremented.

The Query to update it incudes the version number from the document that had
been read from the database.

This is simple, but where there is contention the record must be reread, 
changes reconciled and written back. It also would allow, for example
two humans to spend time editing in a UI only for one person's changes to be 
rejected - unlike the pessimistic model.

With contention this can be 100s of times slower than simply using server update 
locking.
